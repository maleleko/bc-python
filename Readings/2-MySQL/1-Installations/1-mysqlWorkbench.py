                # What is MySQL Workbench?

# MySQL Workbench is just a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for us to interact with MySQL, one of the most popular relational databases in the world - through SQL commands. 
# It is not necessary to use a GUI. We may interact with our MySQL databases through the terminal, but the GUI makes it much easier to see our data and create new databases.

                # Why MySQL Workbench?

# We use MySQL Workbench when we are interacting with our databases because it will help us run some SQL queries. It also has a great interface where we can map out our tables and establish relationships between them.
