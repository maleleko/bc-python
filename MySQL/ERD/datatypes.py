# Simple Data Types:

    # VARCHAR(number of characters)
        # Used to store strings of characters as non-numeric values that can be up to 255 characters.

        # It is called a VARCHAR because it can store a variable number of characters and will only use the space required for each record that is stored in the database

        # VARCHAR should be used for values with different character lengths like an email, first_name, or last_name.

    # CHAR(number of characters)
        # Also used to store characters as non-numeric values, however, it will use up all space for the set number of characters regardless of what value is added.

        # For instance, if I set CHAR(15), and I try to store the value "Coding", it will use up the equivalent of 15 characters even though "Coding" is only 6 characters long.

        # Char is good to use for things that will always be a given number of characters. Char would work well for something like a state_abbreviation.

    #  INT
        # Used to store integers.

        # The columns you will mostly find using the INT are things like a unique identifier for each table. INT is good to use for most normal number values like a phone_number or a zip_code.

        # unsigned(positive nums only) - can store numerical values from 0 up to 4294967295

        # signed(positive and negative nums) - can store numerical vals from -2147483648 up to 2147483647

    # BIGINT(lol)
        # BIGINT would be used for columns that would need to store huge numbers. In most cases, you wouldn't need BIGINT, but if you wanted to store something like a Facebook id when using Facebook's API, since they have over a billion users the id will need to be a data type of BIGINT.

        # unsigned (again positive numbers only) - can store numerical values from 0 up to 18446744073709551615

        # signed (positive and negative numbers) - can store numerical values from 9223372036854775807 to -9223372036854775808.

    # TINYINT(lol)
        # TINYINT would be good to use for numbers that will be relatively small. A good example of something that would use a TINYINT is user level identifier (0 - inactive user, 1 - active user, 9 - admin).

        # unsigned - can store numerical values from 0 up to 255

        # signed - can store numerical values from -128 up to 127

    # FLOAT
        # Used to store floating point numbers (numbers that need to have decimal places). An example column for this would be like an item_cost.

    # TEXT
        # Used to store a large amount of text, like a description, message, or comment. Use this for any text that VARCHAR() is too small to handle.

    # DATETIME
        # Used for time-stamps, like created_at and updated_at, or to store a date and time in the format YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss

    # DATE
        # Used for storing general dates in the format YYYY-MM-DD, for example, a birthdate.
